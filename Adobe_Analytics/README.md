#About
This is the *legacy* solution for sending Demdandbase Company Profile attributes to Adobe Analytics via Conversion Variables.
If you are considering using the solutoin, first consult with your Demandbase Customer Success Manager or Solutions Consultant.

#Data Connector
The **current best approach** is to use the native *Data Connector* available from within Adobe Analytics.
Under the main *Adobe Marketing Cloud* menu, select *Data Connectors*, then choose *Demandbase*, listed in the *Other* category.

The Data Connector is a simple 5-step wizard that enables the integration of up-to 16 Demandbase company profile attributes using only 2 Conversion Variables (eVars).

If more company profile attributes are desired, a JavaScript solution is available to add more attributes via a 3rd Conversion variable.

##Prerequisites
See [Integration Prerequisites](http://microsite.omniture.com/t2/help/en_US/connectors/demandbase/#Integration_Prerequisites).

##Deployment
Installing the integration involves placing two blocks of JavaScript within your `AppMeasurement.js` (or `s_code.js`):
1. Demandbase plugin generated by the Data Connector wizard
2. [Integrate Module](http://microsite.omniture.com/t2/help/en_US/connectors/demandbase/#Including_the_Integrate_Module)

See the [complete deployment guide](http://microsite.omniture.com/t2/help/en_US/connectors/demandbase/#Deploying_the_Integration) within the Adobe Analytics in-product documentation.
