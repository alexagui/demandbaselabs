=About=
This is the *legacy* solution for sending Demdandbase Company Profile attributes to Adobe Analytics via Conversion Variables.
If you are considering using the solutoin, first consult with your Demandbase Customer Success Manager or Solutions Consultant.

=Data Connector=
The **current best approach** is to use the native "Data Connector" available from within the Adobe Analyics Admin Console.

The Data Connector is a simple 5-step wizard that enables the integration of up-to 16 Demandbase company profile attributes using only 2 Conversion Variables.
If more company profile attributes are desired, a JavaScript solution is available to add a 8 more attributes via a 3rd Conversion variable.
