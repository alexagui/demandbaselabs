Written by Anthony Palazzetti

Created:    January 16, 2014

This WordPress plugin is designed to allow access to the Demandbase API through the standard token/IP method.
If you do not know which API you are using, you can find out by looking at the URL you are using.
If it's of the form: api.demandbase.com/api/v2/ip.json?query=XX.XX.XX.XX&key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX then you are using the CORRECT API for use with this plugin.

#Installation

1. If you have an existing Demandbase WordPress plugin, you MUST uninstall it before installing this one.
2. From your WordPress dashboard, go to *"Plugins->Add New"*.
3. Install via upload, then activate the plugin.
4. You must set your API key after installation. To do this, click *"Demandbase"* on the left admin navigation bar.

#Usage

Instructions are available via the interface after install on the "Demandbase->How To" page.
